# Taylor Expansion ML Project
The goal of this project is to use Machine Learning to get the Taylor expansion of a function.

This is performed in the form of a Natural Languge Processing task.
Random functions are generated using my module [RandomFunctionGenerator](https://github.com/BoGGoG/RandomFunctionGenerator) and saved as strings.
